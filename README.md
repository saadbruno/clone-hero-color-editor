This is a simple color editor for Clone Hero that automatically generates a preview in-browser, so you can see what your color profile looks like before inserting it into the game.

It generates the `.ini` data, so you can paste it into the Clone Hero custom colors folder, and also supports receiving data from the user.


## Roadmap
Currently it only supports the basic 5 fret Guitar, it doesn't display sustains, star power, open notes, ho-po, taps and drums. But the ide ais to add all that in the future (PR's are welcome!)
